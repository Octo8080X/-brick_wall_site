## Introduction

Brick Wall is simple HTTP/HTTPS only Web application firewall.

It is intended to run with Deno deploy.
The purpose of the Brick Wall is to separate the security (e.g., prohibit access by IP) functionality from the applications running on the Deno Deploy.  
It is then to provide this functionality dynamically and with extensions as needed.
